# Predicting_Survivability_Patients
This is a R Markdown of a data project in which I looked into the survivability of patients who exeprience heart failure. Each year 17.8 million people lost their lives due to the Cardiovascular diseases as the number one cause of death globally, which accounts for ~32% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure -refers to an occasion in which heart cannot pump enough blood thatâ€™s required for functionality of the body- is one of the most common events caused by Cardiovascular diseases. In this project I am trying to predict, based on several health measures, that if a patient will survive a heart failure or not.
The dataset is publicly available on UCI machine learning repository: [link to data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records)
This project serves as my capstone project for the Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining.
All the work reported in the notebook including the problem definition, cleaning, reducing and preparing the data and the exploratory data analysis is original.
