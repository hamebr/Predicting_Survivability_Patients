# Predicting_Survivability_Patients
This is a R Markdown of a data project in which I looked into the survivability of patients who exeprience heart failure. 
The dataset is publicly available on UCI machine learning repository: [link to data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records)
This project serves as my capstone project for the Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining.
All the work reported in the notebook including the problem definition, cleaning, reducing and preparing the data and the exploratory data analysis is original.
